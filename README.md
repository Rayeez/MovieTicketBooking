# Comprehensive Movie Theater Booking System
This project combines a Flask API for movie and theater management, a MongoDB Docker setup for data storage, a Python web scraping script for movie information retrieval, and an optional React-based frontend for an intuitive user interface. This system allows you to manage, retrieve, and update movie and theater information efficiently.
